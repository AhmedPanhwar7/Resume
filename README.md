# Introduction about myself

Hi, my name is Ahmed Panhwar.
I am currently studying MS Data Analytics at Tufts University, Medford. I have updated my resume here and I am looking forward to doing an internship in summer 2023.
I am looking for an internship that will provide me with detail-level experience in data processing, cleaning, and sorting. I am a proactive, keen, and dedicated individual
who looks for exciting challenges in life and embraces a fast learning experience. I have done a recent data analytics project where I worked on multiple models to
assess hypertension and evaluated various models like KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
