# Introduction about myself

Hi, my name is Ahmed Panhwar
I am currently studying MS Data Analytics at Tufts University, Medford. I have updated my resume here and I am looking forward to doing an internsip in summer 2023
I am looking for an internship that will provide me detail level experience of data processing, cleaning and sorting. I am a proactive, keen and dedicated individual
who looks for exciting challenges in life and embrace a fast learning experience. I have done a recent data analytics project where I have worked on multiple models to
assess hypertension and evaulated various models like KNN, SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
